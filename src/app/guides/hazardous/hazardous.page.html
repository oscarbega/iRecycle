      <h2>How to Manage Hazardous Waste</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to manage hazardous waste safely:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify hazardous waste materials in your home or workplace.</li>

          Transport hazardous waste to disposal facilities following safety
          guidelines and regulations.
