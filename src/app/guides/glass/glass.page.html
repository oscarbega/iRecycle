      <h2>How to Recycle Glass</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to recycle glass:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Separate glass by color (clear, green, and brown) as different colors
          have different compositions and melting points.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove any non-glass contaminants, such as caps, corks, and labels,
          before recycling.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse glass containers to remove any food residue or liquids.</li>
        <li>
          Place recyclable glass in the designated recycling bin or take it to a
          recycling center.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid breaking glass as broken glass can be hazardous to recycling
          workers. If glass breaks accidentally, clean it up carefully and
          dispose of it properly.
        </li>
