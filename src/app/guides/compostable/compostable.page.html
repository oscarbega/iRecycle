      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to our recycling guide on compostable waste! Composting is a
        natural process that transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil
        amendment. Let's explore how you can compost effectively.

      <h2>Why Compost?</h2>
      <p>
        Composting helps divert organic waste from landfills, reduces methane
        emissions, and creates valuable compost for soil enrichment. By
        composting, you can contribute to a healthier environment and
        sustainable soil management.

      <h2>How to Compost</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to compost effectively:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Collect organic waste, such as fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee
          grounds, eggshells, and yard waste, in a compost bin or pile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Layer green materials (nitrogen-rich) and brown materials
          (carbon-rich) to create a balanced compost pile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aerate the compost regularly by turning it with a pitchfork or compost
          aerator to promote decomposition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitor the moisture levels of the compost pile and adjust as needed
          to maintain a damp but not waterlogged environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the compost is dark, crumbly, and earthy-smelling, it's ready to
          use in gardens, lawns, and planters.
        </li>
      </ol>
